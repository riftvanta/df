The original Flask-Bootstrap package has been deprecated and replaced by Bootstrap-Flask.

## Error You Might See
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Flask-Bootstrap==2.3.3
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
```diff
- Flask-Bootstrap==2.3.3
+ Bootstrap-Flask==2.3.3
```

### 2. Updated app/__init__.py
```diff
- from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap5
+ from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap

- bootstrap = Bootstrap5()
+ bootstrap = Bootstrap()
```

## 🧪 Test the Fix

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_bootstrap.py
```

Expected output:
```

```

## 📦 Manual Installation (if needed)

## 🔧 What Changed

1. **Package Name**: `Flask-Bootstrap` → `Bootstrap-Flask`
2. **Import**: Same import path (`flask_bootstrap`) but different initialization
3. **API**: Bootstrap-Flask provides better Bootstrap 5 support
4. **Maintenance**: Bootstrap-Flask is actively maintained while Flask-Bootstrap is deprecated

This fix ensures your Manufacturing Workload Management App will deploy successfully on Railway! 🏭 

## 🔥 Additional Fix: Bootstrap4 Deprecation Warning

### Issue
During app startup, encountered warning:
```
UserWarning: For Bootstrap 4, please import and use "Bootstrap4" class, the "Bootstrap" class is deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.
```

### Root Cause
The `Bootstrap` class is deprecated in favor of `Bootstrap4` for Bootstrap 4 compatibility.

### ✅ Solution Applied
**Updated app/__init__.py**:
```diff
- from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap
+ from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap4

- bootstrap = Bootstrap()
+ bootstrap = Bootstrap4()
```

### Result
✅ **RESOLVED** - Deprecation warning eliminated, app uses proper Bootstrap4 class.

**Status**: All Bootstrap-Flask issues are now resolved! The app should start cleanly without any warnings. 🎉
